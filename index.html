            <p class="opening">The Oklahoma Sooners football team is one 
                of the most successful college football programs
                 in the country. I have been a fan for as long
                  as I remember. Sitting in front of our old RCA
                   console TV in the living room on Thanksgiving
                    day watching OU and Nebraska battle for the Big 8
                     and National championships are some of my fondest
                      memories. I would marvel at the ability
                    of great players like Billy Simms, Joe Washington,
                and Steve Davis. I love watching the OU Sooners play
            football! </p>
